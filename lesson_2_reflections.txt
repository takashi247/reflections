Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: I guess when we initialize a repository, the directory is recognized as git repository
and we can start using various git commands to that directory.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?

A: The staging area is the place to temporally store files to be committed. Those files
are transferred from the working directory and commitments are recorded in the repository.
