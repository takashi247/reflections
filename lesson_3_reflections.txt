Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When I change my laptop to a new one so that I can save all the file in my local drive
into the cloud server and download them to the new laptop or when I colaborate with other
people to tackle a large project.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: In order to decide when to synclonize the repository with the remote flexibly.
