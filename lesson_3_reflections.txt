Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When I change my laptop to a new one so that I can save all the file in my local drive
into the cloud server and download them to the new laptop or when I colaborate with other
people to tackle a large project.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: In order to decide when to synclonize the repository with the remote flexibly.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

A: We use forks when we copy a Git on the GitHub platform. We use clones when we copy the
Git on my GitHub to my local drive. Finally, we use branches when we try to experiment some
new features keeping the master version as it is.
